## Additional Considerations
    Focus on creating a robust data pipeline first - log analysis success depends heavily on proper preprocessing
    Consider using a multi-stage approach: anomaly detection → contextual information gathering → root cause generation
    Plan for both offline (batch) and online (real-time) processing modes
    Develop clear metrics for success - quantitative (accuracy, F1 score) and qualitative (IT operator satisfaction)

This project combines NLP, anomaly detection, and causal inference, so start with foundational papers in these areas to build a solid understanding before implementatio
