 Let's walk through how an OpenStack log would be transformed into an input suitable for LogBERT.

ðŸ§¾ Step-by-Step: From Raw OpenStack Log to LogBERT Input

ðŸ”¹ 1. Raw OpenStack Log (Example)
2025-05-30 10:15:23.120  ERROR nova.compute.manager [req-abc123] Instance failed to spawn
2025-05-30 10:15:23.121  WARNING nova.scheduler.client.report [req-abc123] Placement API returned HTTP 404
2025-05-30 10:15:23.122  INFO nova.compute.manager [req-abc123] Cleaning up instance
These logs are:
Timestamped
Structured (module, severity, message)
Repetitive in structure â†’ ideal for LogBERT

ðŸ”¹ 2. Log Parsing â†’ Templates
You use a log parser like Drain3 to convert raw logs into log templates. These remove variable parts (like instance IDs, UUIDs, timestamps), so patterns become learnable.
After parsing:
[ERROR] nova.compute.manager - Instance failed to spawn
[WARNING] nova.scheduler.client.report - Placement API returned HTTP *
[INFO] nova.compute.manager - Cleaning up instance
Then further abstracted into templates (if needed):

Instance failed to spawn  
Placement API returned HTTP *  
Cleaning up instance

ðŸ”¹ 3. Prepare Input Sequences
LogBERT processes sequences of templates (like sentences in NLP). Example input (window size = 3):

log_sequence = [
    "Instance failed to spawn",
    "Placement API returned HTTP *",
    "Cleaning up instance"
]
Each token in the sequence is like a word in a sentence to BERT â€” LogBERT treats this like:

[CLS] Instance failed to spawn [SEP]
Placement API returned HTTP * [SEP]
Cleaning up instance [SEP]
You can prepare batches of such sequences and feed them into the model.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Final Input Format for Model
In a training or inference pipeline:
Each sequence is tokenized (using a tokenizer trained or adapted for log templates)
Converted to tensors (like in Hugging Face BERT input: input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids)
Sent through LogBERT for classification/anomaly scoring

ðŸ§  Recap
Stage	Example Output
Raw Log	2025-05-30 10:15:23 ERROR nova.compute...
Parsed Template	Instance failed to spawn
Input Sequence	[ "Instance failed to spawn", "Placement API returned HTTP *", "Cleaning up instance" ]
LogBERT Output	Anomaly score (e.g., 0.91) or binary label
