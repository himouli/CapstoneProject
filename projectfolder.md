Below is a sequence of shell/git commands to:

1. Create the exact folder structure on your laptop
2. Copy in (or create) the files from the canvas
3. Initialize a Git repository
4. Commit everything
5. Push to a new GitHub repo

---

## 1. Create the project root and subfolders

```bash
# 1. Move to whatever parent directory you want
cd ~/projects

# 2. Create the top-level folder and subfolders
mkdir -p logbert-openstack/{data/raw/v1,data/structured,data/processed,etl,train,models,metadata,config}

# 3. Enter the project folder
cd logbert-openstack
```

At this point, you should have:

```
logbert-openstack/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   │   └── v1/
│   ├── structured/
│   └── processed/
├── etl/
├── train/
├── models/
├── metadata/
└── config/
```

---

## 2. Add or copy your code files into the right places

Assuming you have the three Python scripts from the canvas (`parse_logs.py`, `prepare_dataset.py`, `train_logbert.py`), do something like:

```bash
# Copy (or create) parse_logs.py into etl/
cp /path/to/parse_logs.py etl/parse_logs.py

# Copy (or create) prepare_dataset.py into etl/
cp /path/to/prepare_dataset.py etl/prepare_dataset.py

# Copy (or create) train_logbert.py into train/
cp /path/to/train_logbert.py train/train_logbert.py
```

If you’d rather create them from scratch, use your editor inside each folder:

```bash
# Example: open an editor
nano etl/parse_logs.py
# (paste code and save)
```

You can also create an empty README now:

```bash
touch README.md
```

---

## 3. Initialize a Git repository

```bash
# 1. Initialize git
git init

# 2. Stage all existing folders/files
git add .

# 3. Make the initial commit
git commit -m "Initial project structure and ETL/train scripts"
```

---

## 4. Create a GitHub repo and add it as a remote

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) → click “New” → name it e.g. `logbert-openstack` → “Create repository”.
2. GitHub will show you a remote URL. Suppose it is:

```
git@github.com:<your-username>/logbert-openstack.git
```

Back in your terminal, run:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/logbert-openstack.git
```

*(Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username, or use the HTTPS URL if you prefer.)*

---

## 5. Push the initial commit to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main           # make sure your local branch is named `main`
git push -u origin main      # push commit to GitHub
```

---

## 6. Verify on GitHub

* Navigate to `https://github.com/<your-username>/logbert-openstack` in your browser.
* You should see the folder structure and files you just pushed.

---

### Recap of all commands in one block

```bash
cd ~/projects
mkdir -p logbert-openstack/{data/raw/v1,data/structured,data/processed,etl,train,models,metadata,config}
cd logbert-openstack

# (Copy/create your Python scripts into etl/ and train/ here)

touch README.md

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project structure and ETL/train scripts"

# (Replace <your-username> with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/logbert-openstack.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

After this, your local folder is a Git repo mirrored on GitHub. Any future changes can be committed and pushed with:

```bash
git add <modified_files>
git commit -m "describe changes"
git push
```

That’s it—your project is now under version control and live on GitHub.
