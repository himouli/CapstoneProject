# Step-by-Step Model Development

# Model Architecture Design

## For the Anomaly Detection component:
    You'll build a system that learns what "normal" log patterns look like
    Options include:
        LogBERT: A specialized version of BERT trained to understand log data
        LSTM networks: Good at detecting anomalies in sequential data like logs
        Autoencoders: These learn to compress and reconstruct normal logs, and fail when seeing unusual patterns

## For the RCA Generation component:
    You'll use a large language model (transformer-based) that can:
        Process information about the detected anomaly
        Generate human-readable explanations about what happened
        Respond to follow-up questions interactively

## System Integration:

    Design how these components will communicate
    Plan how detected anomalies will be enriched with context before being sent to the RCA generator

# Initial Model Training

## Training the Anomaly Detector:
    Feed it lots of normal OpenStack logs so it learns what's typical
    Include some examples of failures so it learns to identify problems
    Adjust parameters until it reliably flags real issues without too many false alarms

## Preparing the RCA Generator:
    Take a pre-trained language model (like a variant of BERT, T5, or GPT)
    Fine-tune it on:
        OpenStack documentation
        Examples of log patterns paired with known root causes
        Technical explanations in the IT operations domain

## Query Processing:
    Build a system that translates user questions like "What caused the server outage?" into specific prompts for your model

# Evaluation Framework

## Create test scenarios:
    Collect examples of real OpenStack failures with known causes
    Create synthetic test cases for issues that might be rare but important

## Develop metrics:
    For anomaly detection: precision, recall, F1 score, and detection time
    For RCA generation: relevance, accuracy, and actionability of explanations
    For the overall system: time to resolution and IT operator satisfaction

# Visual Model Architecture

Here's what the overall system architecture might look like:

The system works by:
    Continuously monitoring logs for unusual patterns
    When something strange is detected, gathering context around the issue
    Feeding this information to your RCA model
    Using the RCA model to generate explanations when users ask questions
    Presenting clear, actionable explanations to IT staff
